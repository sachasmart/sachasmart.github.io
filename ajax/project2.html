        <h5>Challenge</h5>
        <p>Giants of Africa and the Office of Hon. Ahmed Hussen host an annual forum for underserved youth in the local community to celebrate the legacy of Nelson Mandela and empower youth to affect change in their communities. Given the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 forum, "Humanity", was held virtually and open to schools across the GTA.</p>

    <div class="col1-3">
        <h5>Process</h5>
        <p>I coordinated with school boards, superintendents, and the principals and teachers of over 160 schools to promote the event and answer questions. Our team faced a number of technical challenges - predominately, ensuring that there was sufficient bandwidth to accommodate all participants. I recruited participants from across Canada and North America and wrote speaking notes that reflected the core message of the event. </p>

    <div class="col1-3">
        <h5>Result</h5>
        <p>Over 37,000 students across the GTA participated in the virtual youth forum. Minister Hussen was widely applauded for the message of the event and the production quality.</p>
