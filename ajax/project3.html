		<h5>Challenge</h5>
		<p>
			Near the beginning of the 2019 federal government elections, our team had
			an idea to promote the accomplishments of the liberal governments in
			short, visibly appealing, messages. The "Policy Wall" was the entire side
			of our warehouse office and became staple for resident's to take photos,
			Minister Hussen to conduct interviews, and for volunteers to quickly check
			as they were calling voters.

	<div class="col1-3">
		<h5>Process</h5>
		<p>
			This project was was a spur of the moment between our media coordinator
			and myself.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col1-3">
		<h5>Result</h5>
		<p>
			Within 18 hours this idea went from nothing to a completed print and
			hanging on our campaign office's wall. This was a result of teamwork,
			optimism, and a GSD attitude.
